Testing "my ok test function" in mytest.t.cc:
! mytest.t.cc:432     thing.works()         ok
This is just some crap that I printed while counting to 3.
! mytest.t.cc.433     3 < 4                 ok
! mytest.t.cc.435     3 < 5                 ok
! mytest.t.cc.437     3 < 6                 ok
! mytest.t.cc.439     3 < 7                 ok
